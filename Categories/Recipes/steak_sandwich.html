                <h3>How to Prepare</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F, and spray a baking sheet with cooking oil. Season the steak with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Preheat a small nonstick skillet over medium heat with cooking oil. When pan is hot enough for oil to slide around easily, add the steak. 
                        Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side or until steak reaches desired doneness. Set aside until cool enough to handle; slice thinly.
                    </li>
                    <li>Meanwhile, sauté onions in the same pan, on medium-high heat, until golden brown. Set aside.</li>
                    <li>Add the bread slices to the baking sheet. Top each bread slice with one slice of cheddar cheese. Bake for about 5 minutes until cheese is melted.</li>
                    <li>Layer the steak, onions, and bell peppers onto each bread slice, and serve.</li>
                </ol>
