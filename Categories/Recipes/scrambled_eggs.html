                <h3>How to Prepare</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Crack four eggs into a bowl and mix with a fork thoroughly until mixture is uniform</li>
                    <li>Heat a medium pan over low-medium heat and add butter to pan to coat it</li>
                    <li>Pour in egg mixture to pan and let it cook. As the eggs are coocking, use a spatula
                        to move the cooked parts of the eggs to the center of the pan and tilt the pan so that the runny
                        parts are at the edge of the pan. Repeat the process until the majority of the eggs are cooked
                    </li>
                    <li>Mash eggs with a spatula to scramble them then carefully pour the scrambled eggs on a plate</li>
                    <li>Season eggs with salt, pepper, parsley flakes, and optionally, hot sauce then enjoy!</li>
                </ol>
